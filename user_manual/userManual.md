# The Aim Of Our App
TastyTravel aims to allow the user to search for either restaurants, bars, or cafes that two people could meet at. For this manual,  
we will pretend it is the user’s location and their friend’s location. A more in depth guide with photos is shown later. The user  
successfully finds places to meet by doing the following steps;

### Step 1
The user inputs their location into the first text box with the hint ‘Enter your location’. 
<br/><br/>

### Step 2
The user will pick their chosen mode of transport. They can select either Walk, Car, or Bike.
<br/><br/>

### Step 3
The user will repeat steps 1 and 2 for their friend. The user will input their friend’s location into the second text box  
‘Enter your friend’s location’.
<br/><br/>

### Step 4
The user will pick their friend’s chosen mode of transport.
<br/><br/>

### Step 5
The user will pick the type of meeting place from the dropdown menu. They can select either Bar, Cafe, or Restaurant.
<br/><br/>

### Step 6
When the user is happy with all the choices, they can press ‘SEARCH’ to arrive at their unique map. 
<br/><br/>

The map will show the two locations inputted as well as the names of some Places Of Interest.
