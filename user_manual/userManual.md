# Overview 
TastyTravel aims to allow the user to search for either restaurants, bars, or cafes that two people could meet at. The app works best for urban areas. 
For this manual, we will pretend it is the user’s location and their friend’s location. The user successfully finds places to meet by doing the following steps;

### Step 1
The user inputs their location into the first text box with the hint ‘Enter your location’. 

### Step 2
The user will pick their chosen mode of transport. They can select either Walk, Car, or Bike.

### Step 3
The user will repeat steps 1 and 2 for their friend. The user will input their friend’s location into the second text box ‘Enter your friend’s location’.

### Step 4
The user will pick their friend’s chosen mode of transport.

### Step 5
The user will pick the type of meeting place from the dropdown menu. They can select either Bar, Cafe, or Restaurant.

### Step 6
When the user is happy with all the choices, they can press ‘SEARCH’ to arrive at their unique map. The map will show the two locations inputted as well as the names of some Places  
Of Interest.

# Creating An Account 

On opening the app, you will be met with the start screen. Here, you can sign in, sign up, or continue without an account. Creating an account is easy and allows you to save places  
that you find when searching the map.

Creating an account requires you to enter an email and password of your choice. The password must be at least 6 characters long and the email address must be valid like the  
following:  **example@gmail.com**  

<div align="center">

# Navigation

There are three main screens that the user can switch between using the bottom navigation bar.

1.  The home page is the screen that you will first see after signing in. Here you can find the search function and saved places. Start the search function by pressing on the white  
search bar that says FIND PLACES TO MEET. Refer to the guide with images below to learn how to search. Look at your saved places by pressing the text 'Saved Places' or the image  
underneath it.  

<div align="center">
<img alt="home page" src="images/homePage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

2.  The about page will help you learn how to use the map and provides contact information. We recommend reading it before searching to get a good understanding of the app.  
This page is scrollable. Follow the steps to get a successful result.  

<div align="center">
<img alt = "about page" src="images/aboutPage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

3.  The profile page contains a clear saved places button, sign out button and delete account button. Don't worry if you press them by mistake, there will be a prompt asking are  
you sure. The profile page also links to our settings page. It will be explained later.

# Searching For A Place To Meet

When you open the search page there will be five parameters that you must fill out. You can not progress to the map without filling them all in.
*  You must enter your location and the mode of transport you will take.
*  Then enter your friend's location and mode of transport.
*  Finally, choose the type of place you want to meet from the dropdown menu. You have the option between either a bar, cafe, or restaurant.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "search page" src="images/searchPage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

Start by pressing the first box with the text 'Enter Your Location'. As you type, the search box will auto-suggest places for you.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "search box" src="images/searchBox.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

When you have all the parameters entered, press the search button to see your map.

# Understanding The Map

The map will show you two red markers on the map that represent the locations you entered. You can press on the markers to see which is your location and their location.  

<div align="center">
<img alt = "map results" src="images/mapResult.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

The results will show a list of places based on your parameters. It is a scrollable list that will give you maximum 20 meeting points. You can press on the names of the results to  
show it pop up as a violet coloured marker. If you like one of the places, you can save it by pressing the red heart.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "marker results" src="images/showMarker.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

The map can be styled differently by returning to the profile page and going to the settings page.

# Styling The Map

There are two toggle buttons that can alter the appearance of the map. They are off by default.  

<div align="center">
<img alt = "map results" src="images/settings.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

1. The first toggle button will draw an isochrone around the two inputted locations. An isochrone is a group of coordinates that are joined by black lines. They represent the area  
that you can travel to in 15 minutes depending on your mode of transport. 

2. The second toggle button will show you where the best meeting point is. It is a blue marker and the places returned to you when you search are ranked by their distance to this  
point.

# Looking At Saved Places

You can find all your saved places by going to the home page and pressing the image of food. The map stores all the points you ever saved as violet markers. You can click on those  
markers to see the names and you can open Google Maps to get directions to those points.
