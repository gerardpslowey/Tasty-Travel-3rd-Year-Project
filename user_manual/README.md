# Overview 
TastyTravel aims to allow the user to search for either restaurants, bars, or cafes that two people could meet at all over the world. The app works best for urban areas and  
cities where the availablity of these social places is higher. For this manual, we will pretend it is the user’s location and their friend’s location. In brief, the user  
successfully finds places to meet by doing the following steps;

### Step 1
The user inputs their location into the first text box with the hint ‘Enter your location’. 

### Step 2
The user will pick their chosen mode of transport. They can select either Walk, Car, or Bike.

### Step 3
The user will repeat steps 1 and 2 for their friend. The user will input their friend’s location into the second text box ‘Enter your friend’s location’.

### Step 4
The user will pick their friend’s chosen mode of transport.

### Step 5
The user will pick the type of meeting place from the dropdown menu. They can select either Bar, Cafe, or Restaurant.

### Step 6
When the user is happy with all the choices, they can press ‘SEARCH’ to arrive at their unique map. The map will show the two locations inputted as red markers as well as a  
scrollable list of the recommended places that the two people can travel to. Press one of the names to show it's location as a purple marker on the map.

that you like when searching the map and it allows you to look at your previously searched locations.

<div align="center">

# Navigation

There are three main screens that the user can switch between using the bottom navigation bar.

1.  The home page is the screen that you will first see after signing in. Here you can find the search function, your saved places, and your history of searches.  
Start the search function by pressing on the white search bar that says FIND PLACES TO MEET. Refer to the section Searching For A Place To Meet for more information. You can  
look at your saved places by pressing on the image of coffee labelled 'My Saved Places'. Similarly, you can view your history of searches by pressing on the image of beers  
labelled 'My History'.

<div align="center">
<img alt="home page" src="images/homePage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

2.  The about page will help you learn how to use the map and provides contact information for Michael and Gerard. We recommend reading this section before using the app's search  
function. The about page will help you to understand the parameters and capablities of the app. Use your thumb to scroll down the page to read all the instructions.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "about page" src="images/aboutPage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

3.  The profile page includes five buttons. From top to bottom, there is a CLEAR FAVOURITES button that lets you delete your collection of saved places. Below that, there is a  
CLEAR HISTORY button that deletes your past searches. You can then find a SETTINGS button that brings you to two different toggles that can alter the map. Refer to the section  
Styling The Map for more information. After this, there is a LOGOUT button and DELETE ACCOUNT button. Don't worry if you press them by mistake, a prompt will pop up asking are  
you sure.

# Searching For A Place To Meet

When you open the search page there will be five parameters that you must fill out. You can not progress to the map without filling them all in.
*  You must enter your location and the mode of transport you will take.
*  You must then enter your friend's location and mode of transport.
*  Finally, choose the type of place you want to meet from the dropdown menu. You have the option between either a Bar, Cafe, or Restaurant.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "search page" src="images/searchPage.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

Start by pressing the first box with the text 'Enter Your Location'. As you type, the search box will auto-suggest places for you.

<div align="center">
<img alt = "search box" src="images/searchBox.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

When you have all the parameters entered, press the search button to see your map.

# Understanding The Map

The map will show you two red markers on the map that represent the locations you entered. You can press on the markers to see which is your location and their location.  

<div align="center">
<img alt = "map results" src="images/mapResult.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

The results will show a list of places based on your parameters. It is a scrollable list that will give you maximum 20 meeting points. You can press on the names of the results to  
show it pop up on the map as a violet coloured marker. If you like one of the places, you can save it by pressing the red heart. 

<div align="center">
<img alt = "marker results" src="images/showMarker.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

The map can be styled differently by returning to the profile page and going to the settings page.

# Styling The Map

There are two toggle buttons that can alter the appearance of the map. They are off by default.  

<div align="center">
<img alt = "map results" src="images/settings.png"  width="220" height="400">  
</div>

1. The first toggle button will draw an isochrone around the two inputted locations. An isochrone is a group of coordinates that are joined by black lines. They represent the area  
that you can travel to in 10 minutes depending on your mode of transport. 

2. The second toggle button will show you where the best meeting point is. It is a blue marker and the places returned to you when you search are ranked by their distance to this  
point.

# My Saved Places

You can find all your saved places by going to the home page and pressing on the image of coffee labelled 'My Saved Places'. The map stores all the points you ever saved as  
violet markers. You can press on any marker to see the place's name and you can get directions to a marker by pressing the pop up on the botom right of the map. This will bring you  
outside the app to Google Maps. If you want to delete your saved places go to the profile page and press on CLEAR FAVOURITES.
